==Short term tasks
* Support for the offset parameter for queries on collections

* Make it easier to create MBID objects or allow usage of ID strings
  where it makes life easier (>= 0.2.1).
* Add usefull constructor parameters to the models (>= 0.2.1).
* Improve API documentation.

==Longer term tasks
* User authentication (0.3.0)
* Support POST in webservice to submit information (0.3.0).
* Querying of user information (0.3.0)
* PUID submission
* Full text search (lucene search queries).
* Implement a command line tool (+mbquery+) for querying the MusicBrainz
  database which will serve as a usefull example for RBrainz.
* Support for common extensions (this could be implemented by adding
  additional extension libraries which extend the existing classes).

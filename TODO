= TODO

== Short term tasks
* Add usefull constructor parameters to the models (>= 0.2.1).
* Improve API documentation.

== Longer term tasks
* Support POST in webservice to submit information (0.3.0).
* PUID submission (0.3.0)
* Full text search (lucene search queries).
* Implement a command line tool (+mbquery+) for querying the MusicBrainz
  database which will serve as a usefull example for RBrainz.
* Support for common extensions (this could be implemented by adding
  additional extension libraries which extend the existing classes).

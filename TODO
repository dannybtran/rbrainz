==Short term tasks
* Support relationships (0.1.1)
* Support for the score parameter in search result. Could be implemented
  a little bit like in PythonMusicBrainz2, but more flexible. Maybe a result
  object over which one can iterate to retrieve all results witch the
  corresponding score. (0.2.0)
   result.each {|entity, score|
     ...
   }
* Support for the offset parameter for queries on collections
  to retrieve results below the 100 results limit. Could be easily integrated
  into the result object (see previous point). (0.2.0)
* Make it easier to create MBID objects or allow usage of ID strings
  where it makes life easier.

==Longer term tasks
* Calculation of disc IDs (0.3.0)
* User authentication (0.4.0)
* Querying of user information (0.4.0)
* PUID submission
* Full text search (lucene search queries).
